# Travel Her Way Landing Page

## Intro
Travel Her Way, founded back in 2017, is an outdoor adventure travel company organizing women-only small group tours to bucket-list destinations. The company targets women who want to but lack the confidence to take on these challenges alone. The company aims to connect women with the same goal and build a community to let women support each other and fulfill their dreams.

In this projet, I conducted comprehensive UX research and UX/UI design to provide frictionless online shopping experiences. I also built the landing page from scratch.
